<center><p><style="font-size: 75px;">I am Eureka, the creator of CookMate. CookMate is a school project I am coding. I am in year 5, I am ten years old. In early 2017 I was looking and listening for opportunities and came across this common problem - recipes using foreign mesurements. CookMate converts these mesurements to less foreign ones. This makes cooking easier. Through the process of making CookMate, I have leaned Swift Playgrounds, Python, HTML, JS and CCS. I have had help from a mentor in Year 7 who has shared his knowledge of coding with me.</p></center>
